                    Is it possible to make music without some musical
                    instruments in your hands? It is now possible. Thanks to a
                    special digital glove! To start using it, you need to
                    configure the necessary mode using a control located in the
                    wrist region. After which, you can simulate that you’re
                    playing any instrument. This device has been developed not
                    only for musicians and DJs, but for all who want to access
                    this art. The glove is designed with the controller which
                    allows combining all kinds of sounds for your fingers,
                    palms, and forearms. The gadget has eight sensors – three of
                    the palms of the hands and one on each finger. It’s possible
                    to configure each sensor separately which offers great
                    possibilities for your art.

                    Now, it’s a magic. Their singular speaker is floating in the
                    air and is really impressive and amazing – it flies! Thanks
                    to a magnetic levitation system! This device has a nice
                    platform and a balloon – like a speaker which rotates when
                    it is used. The device connects via Bluetooth to a distance
                    of up to 20 meters. The device can run for six hours without
                    being recharged, so you can enjoy your favorite songs for a
                    long time. The loudspeaker is compact and ideal for any
                    decor.

                    are controlled and configured with a mobile device. The
                    diversity of modes of this device is incredible and allows

                    room by creating an unrepeatable atmosphere of light, and
                    there are more than 16,000 colors with the great assistant
                    of a mobile application. You can control the light,
